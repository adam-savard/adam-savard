# Adam Savard

## Summary

I graduated from NBCC Fredericton in 2019 as a Programmer Analyst; I've been working for [The Black Arcs](https://github.com/blackarcs) ([see here also](https://blackarcs.org/)) since 2019 and am currently their Stack Logic Alchemist. This is equivalent to a Senior Software Developer.

I've helped to develop their Citisketch product since I was brought on board, and have accrued a great many skills related to developing software and complex systems. See [Skills](#skills) for more information.

## Skills

Below is a table of skills that I've developed related to software development:

| Language/Ecosystem/Skill | Level of Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Javascript | High | The majority of my projects are written in Javascript/NodeJS; see my repositories tab for details. |
| Node JS | High | The command line tool used by The Black Arcs is written in Node JS, and was developed by me. |
| Docker | Medium | I've built the CI/CD system for The Black Arcs using Docker containers. Still more to learn, but the base is there. |
| System Administration (Linux) | High | I have maintained the servers for The Black Arcs for over 2 years, and experiment with my own homelab to learn further. |
| Terminal (BASH/Linux) | High | I am very familiar with the terminal, and wrote the command line application used by The Black Arcs for database administration. |
| Markdown | High | Markdown is my preferred method of writing documentation. |
| Julia | Low | I've implemented a simple REST API in Julia and am learning to leverage the language further |
| Full Stack Development | High | I have worked on all areas of the Black Arcs codebase, including the API, frontend/client apps, CI/CD, systems admin, etc. |
| AWS | Medium | I have maintained all the AWS systems in use by The Black Arcs since 2020. |
| Bash Scripting | High | I have written custom bash scripts to aid in systems administration. |
| PIXI.JS | High | I have used PIXI.JS extensively over my tenure with The Black Arcs and am very familiar with it. |
