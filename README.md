## Cat Pictures and Code

You've found my github page! I'm glad you came over.

I'm a software developer currently working for The Black Arcs on their Citisketch product (see [Citisketch](http://www.citisketch.com) and [The Black Arcs](http://www.blackarcs.org)).

My public repos don't share the whole story, since the majority of my work is hidden in a private repo; I have approx. 1700 commits not counted here. The language I've grown used to using is vanilla JS, so the majority of my projects focus on that as well.
